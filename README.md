      *Setup Instructions:
      This is an implementation of Iteration 3 that
      is pending refactor
      for the next iteration. There are still bugs that must be fixed.
      The main file is in the main package, named 'main'. The input txt
      file is included and can be edited following the specified
      format, but also including 'elevator number' at the end of
      the string (1 for current iteration).

* Responsibilities of each team member for this iteration:
  Justin and Josh worked on setting the scheduler to function with UDP.
  Justin had an emphasis on the event list and commands.
  Josh had more emphasis on the implementation within the events,
  and the message sending.
  Mahtab and Ahmad worked on setting the elevator and floors to be UDP compatible,
  Ahmad had a focus on setting up the general UDP links and Mahtab had an emphasis on
  the elevator's implementation.
  Just paste this in a text file I cant seem to be able to send it
